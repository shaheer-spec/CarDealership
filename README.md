# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

In this program you can look at cars, add cars, remove cars, and see all the cars. 
It keeps track of everything in a text file so the cars don’t disappear when you close the program.
## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see a menu on the screen so that I can choose what actions to take in the dealership application.
- As a user, I want the system to store information about vehicles and dealerships, so that my data can be organized and reused later.
- As a user, I want the system to load and save vehicle data from a file, so that the dealership inventory is saved between sessions.
- As a user, I want to search, add, and remove vehicles, so that I can manage the dealership’s inventory efficiently.
